				<a href="https://youtu.be/LwSeYUlvvtE" target="_blank">Getting Started with Network Analytics in Python - Eric Sims</a>: This was perhaps the first talk on networks/networkx that I heard given by a non-academic. I wanted to see how it would be, especially since <a href="https://youtu.be/yCCfVQ3UVUQ" target="_blank">I gave a tutorial on networkx last week</a>. I found that Sims spoke about networks very effectively, using everyday examples to explain network metrics, as opposed to plain ol' math (which is what I usually do). I learnt that NetworkX finally has a facility to draw curved edges. Woot woot: <code>nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, ..., connectionstyle=’arc3, rad=0.2’)</code>. Also, there's this thing called <a href="https://itsgorain.medium.com/100daysofnetworks-network-scraper-5a17844789a8" target="_blank">#100DaysOfNetworks</a>. Where do I sign up?
